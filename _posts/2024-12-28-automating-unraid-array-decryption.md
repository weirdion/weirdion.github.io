**Disclaimer:** _This is not meant to be start from basics tutorial. The
following assumes that you are familiar with LUKS encryption and Unraid
basics._

## Overview

As an Unraid user, manually entering encryption passwords at every system boot
can become tedious and inconvenient, especially when your family relies on the
running services and you’re not home to bring the array back online.

There’s several ways to go about doing this, the approach I settled on was to
leverage Github private repository as a secure key storage solution, and
retrieve it temporarily on boot for decryption.

## Why This Approach?

  * Eliminates manual password entry during boot
  * Off-site key-file that can be revoked remotely from Github
  * Uses temporary key storage locally, removing the key-file after decryption
  * Leverages Unraid’s event system for reliable automation
  * Balances security with convenience while following best practices

# The Implementation

## Setting up a new LUKS Key-file

Let’s create a new key-file that can decrypt the encrypted drive(s). LUKS
supports multiple authentication methods per drive, upto 8 for LUKS1 and 32
for LUKS2 ([LUKS man page reference](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cryptsetup-luksAddKey.8.html#:~:text=key%2Dslot%20option.-,The%20maximum%20number%20of%20key%20slots%20depends%20on%20the%20LUKS,0%20and%2031%20for%20LUKS2.)).
This allows us to maintain our existing passphrase(s) while adding a new key-file.

```
# Check available keyslots
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb1

# Generate a cryptographically secure keyfile
dd if=/dev/random bs=32 count=1 of=my-keyfile

# Add the keyfile to your encrypted drive
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdb1 /path/to/my-keyfile
>Enter any existing passphrase:
```
## Secure Key Storage

We are using Github **_private_** repository as a key storage solution, so
let’s create a new one — for this example I’m going to assume the repo name
`foobar`. Once the repository is created, upload the `my-keyfile` from
previous step.

We are going to be accessing the `my-keyfile` using Github’s “Fine-Grained
Personal Access Token”, to enable minimal read permissions and access
authenticated API access.
We can create and manage them under Profile -> Settings -> Developer Settings,
or by accessing the direct link — [Personal Access Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens).

When creating a new token, we want to grant access to the single repository,
`foobar` with the following permissions:

  *  **Contents: “Read-only”** — Fetch the key-file
  *  **Metadata: “Read-only”** — Required for repository access

## Unraid Automation

We’ll leverage Unraid’s event system to manage the keyfile securely. Here’s
how we’ll modify the startup process:

  * Adding custom boot scripts

```
# Set up directory for custom scripts
mkdir -p /boot/custom/bin

# touch script files
touch /boot/custom/bin/{fetch_key,delete_key}
```
* Create script to fetch key-file in `/boot/custom/bin/fetch_key`
Here the `github_pat_XXXyyyZZZ` is the Personal Access Token we generated in
Github, and `/username/foobar` is the username and repository name used.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Only fetch if keyfile doesn't exist
if [[ ! -e /root/keyfile ]]; then
  curl -H "Authorization: token github_pat_XXXYYYZZZ" \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/foobar/main/my-keyfile \
    -o /root/keyfile
fi
```
* Create script to delete key-file after use in `/boot/custom/bin/delete_key`

```
#!/bin/bash

# Remove keyfile after successful array start
rm -f /root/keyfile
```
* Edit `/boot/config/go` to set up our event handlers, this file is used to launch Unraid’s management interface.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Configure event handlers for keyfile management
# Create event directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p /usr/local/emhttp/webGui/event/{starting,started,stopped}
# Copy over the event scripts
cp -f /boot/custom/bin/fetch_key /usr/local/emhttp/webGui/event/starting
cp -f /boot/custom/bin/delete_key /usr/local/emhttp/webGui/event/started
cp -f /boot/custom/bin/fetch_key /usr/local/emhttp/webGui/event/stopped
# Make the scripts executable
chmod a+x /usr/local/emhttp/webGui/event/{starting/fetch_key,started/delete_key,stopped/fetch_key}

# Launch Unraid's management interface
/usr/local/sbin/emhttp &

```
## Enabling Automatic Array Start in Unraid

Finally, we need to enable automatic array start in Unraid web interface:

  * Navigate to Unraid’s web interface
  * Go to Settings -> Disk Settings
  * Set “Enable auto start” to Yes.

# Security Considerations

This implementation includes several security considerations:

  * The key-file is only present on the system during the decrypt process
  * GitHub access is restricted to read-only operations on a private repository
  * The Personal Access Token has minimal scope
  * The original password remains as a backup decryption method

# Conclusion

This setup provides a secure and automated way to decrypt the Unraid array at
boot while maintaining security best practices. The key-file is fetched only
when needed and immediately removed after use, minimizing the window of
exposure.

Remember to keep your Github token secure and regularly audit your security
settings. While this automation adds convenience, it’s crucial to maintain
secure backups of your encryption credentials.
